## xroads

[Xroads](../glossary.md#xroads) is a library for [X-Plane](../glossary.md#x-plane) 11 & 12 that enhances the realism of [Ortho4XP](../glossary.md#ortho4xp) orthophotos by hiding default road polygons generated from databases like OSM â€“ especially useful for ZL17+ orthos, allowing the actual roads from satellite imagery to show through instead. Bridges, highways, expressways, and railway tracks remain visible. Additionally, AI vehicles operate at 70% of their original speed (adjustable via "-v"), creating more realistic conditions. An automatically generated library.txt allows for precise control over transparent roads, while autogen roads continue to display in areas without ortho tiles.
