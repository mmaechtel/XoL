- Sources on Xplane (see link below) describe the installation on a running system. However, the goal of this documentation is to install the Linux system itself and optimize it for Xplane, thus going far beyond a simple Linux installation.
- The Debian distribution was chosen as we want to start with a non-optimized system and then optimize the individual layers
